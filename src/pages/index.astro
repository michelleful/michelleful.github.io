<h1>Michelle Fullwood</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm a linguist working in the natural language processing space.
  My life revolves around words, language, and stories.
  I'm also very into maps and puzzles.
</p>
<p>
  Below, you'll find tools, projects, and lists that I've made.
  I hope you'll find something among it useful.
</p>

<h2>Language tools and explainers</h2>

<div>
<h3><a href="/languages/arabic/fuzzy/">Fuzzy Arabic Dictionary</a></h3>
<p>
  Look up Arabic words, even when you don't know how to spell them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian Grammar</h3>

<p>
  A quick reference companion to Hoch's Middle Egyptian Grammar, inspired
  by the <em>Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</em> series.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div>
<h3><a href="/maps/singapore-roads/">A linguistic street map of Singapore</a></h3>
<a href="/maps/singapore-roads/"><img src="/data/maps/singapore_linguistic_map.png" alt="A linguistic street map of Singapore" class="project-img" /></a>
<p>
  A street map of Singapore in which every road is colour-coded
  with the language of origin of its road name. This was
  <a href="https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2019/06/singapore-street-names/index.html">remade by the Straits Times digital team</a> in 2021.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3><a href="/misc/twide-and-twejudice/">Twide and Twejudice</a></h3>
<p>
  My entry into <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014">NanoGenMo</a> 2014: A version of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>
  in which every word of dialogue is replaced with a word that's used
  in a similar context...on Twitter. For example:
</p>

<blockquote>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all neurosis. How loooooooong has shhe been suuuch a sxey?"</blockquote>
This received some media coverage on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/25/7276157/nanogenmo-robot-author-novel">Verge</a> and <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/another_word_01_16/">Clarkesworld</a>. The "Making Of ..." blogpost is <a href="https://michelleful.github.io/code-blog/2014/12/07/nanogenmo-2014/">here</a>.
</div>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<div>
  <h3><a href="/lists/books/felt-like-discoveries">Books that felt like discoveries</a></h3>

  <p>
    Books that I think are less read than they should be,
    or that I stumbled on serendipitously,
    or that I only know about through being in a
    specialised subcommunity, etc.</p>
